# AIonix 🧠

AIonix is an AI-native console designed to explore how artificial intelligence
can be embedded directly into system-level interfaces.

Unlike typical AI demos, AIonix focuses on:
- Console-first interaction
- Command-driven AI workflows
- OS-inspired design thinking

## ✨ Features
- Dark-themed AI interaction console
- Command history navigation (↑ key)
- Modular input & response pipeline
- Extensible command system

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Java
- Swing (UI)
- Event-driven architecture

## 🚀 Why AIonix?
Most AI projects focus on models.
AIonix focuses on **how humans interact with AI systems**.

This project is part of my journey to understand:
- AI + UI integration
- System-level design
- AI-native interfaces

## 🧭 Roadmap
- Smarter command parsing
- Session-based memory
- Plugin-style commands
- Local AI model integration (Work in progress)
